# genz-utils
A collection of userspace utilities that work with the Gen-Z linux subsystem.
* zephyr is a prototype Gen-Z in-band fabric manager.
* lsgenz is a tool for listing Gen-Z components and their control space structures.
* genz\_pkt is a tool for decoding Gen-Z packets.

This repo replaces zephyr-lsgenz, which should now be considered obsolete.
